How it works:

Run python ib_autotrade_realtest.py.

It reads your provided CSV file (symbols, side, qty, order type, limit price, etc.).

The script connects automatically to IB TWS or Gateway via ib_insync.

Places orders one by one and logs all activity into trading_log_YYYYMMDD.txt.

Works for Stocks, ETFs, Futures, and Forex (IB permissions required for each).

Requirements:

Installed Python 3.10+

ib_insync library (pip install ib_insync)

TWS or IB Gateway running and logged in

API access enabled in TWS (Configure → API → Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients)
